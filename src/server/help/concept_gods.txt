MALSERAPH

Malseraph is one of three Demon Gods that rule the Pandemonium. Its domain is acting, gambling, and violent changes.
Malseraph likes:
 - when its followers disguise themselves or lose their disguise,
 - when its followers polymorph themselves or others,
 - when its followers generally find themselves in dangerous situations.
Malseraph dislikes boredom and its mood constantly deteriorates when nothing interesting happens.
Malseraph is the god of cards and will sometimes draw a card from its own deck to spice things up. When it's in the good mood, the card is likely to be beneficial to the follower. When in the bad mood, the card will abuse the follower, much to Malseraph's joy.
When Malseraph finds followers especially interesting, it can grant its own deck of cards to them. These decks may be decks of war to help in combat or decks of escape to find a way out of tight situations.
