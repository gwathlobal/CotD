MALSERAPH'S PUPPET, THE PANDEMONIUM HIERARCHY
 - Apart from the usual demons stand the servants of the whimsical Demon God Malseraph - those who are called Malseraph's puppets. They lack some powers of other demons but try to please their God to receive its aid. 
 - You kill humans (or fellow demons, by the way) to gain power and heal.
 - Beware of blessed ones. When you touch them, you will burn and consume the blessing. Blessed humans are immune to possession. Though the damage from blessings is minor, it may prove fatal in some situations.
 - Remember, "friendly fire" is allowed for your faction. Be cautious when walking side-by-side with your "friends".
