THE CRIMINALS
 - The criminals (who are opposed to the citizens and the military, but will not attack the Communion) are kept mainly in the prison (except for the Thief).
 - You may start as the Thief, who is found somewhere on the rooftops of the City.
 - Though the Thief is armed with a knife, his primary weapons are stealth and an ability to climb walls. Unlike all other characters, he is able to evade any conflict by hiding in the shadows or getting some place he can not be reached.
 - Note that the citizens, the Communion units, and the military radiate light, while the Demons do not. 
 - As the Thief, you always start at night but a new day will come eventually that will severely hinder your ability to hide. 
 - To win, grab enough gold and get to the edge of the map to leave this accursed City.
 - But beware - the Thief is rather frail and is not immune to possession.
