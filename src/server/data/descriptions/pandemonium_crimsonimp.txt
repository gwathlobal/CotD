CRIMSON IMP, THE PANDEMONIUM HIERARCHY
 - You start as a puny crimson imp who is no match for an angel. Run or summon help when confronted by one.
 - If you gain enough power, you can climb the Pandemonium Hierarchy up: from a crimson imp to a crimson demon and finally to an archdemon.
 - You kill humans (or fellow demons, by the way) to gain power and heal.
 - Crimson imps and demons are able to possess humans. Once "in possession", you will appear as this human to everybody else. Archdemons no longer need this cowardly tactic and can not possess anybody.
 - Beware of blessed ones. When you touch them, you will burn and consume the blessing. Blessed humans are immune to possession. Though the damage from blessings is minor, it may prove fatal in some situations.
 - Your strength is the ability to summon allies to yourself to gang up on your enemy. 
 - Remember, "friendly fire" is allowed for your faction. Be cautious when walking side-by-side with your "friends".
