Given a 2 element list of START-COORD and GOAL-COORD, returns a list

return t if a particular node should be considered as part of the
path, nil if not.  G-FUNC should return the distance of the given
path so far.  H-FUNC should return an estimate of the distance to
the goal, and may depend on many factors"
