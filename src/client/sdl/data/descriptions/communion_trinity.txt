TRINITY MIMICS, THE CELESTIAL COMMUNION
 - Some of the angels grow tired of the ever-humming singlemind and prefer more limited but deeper bonds. These are Trinity mimics, a group of three angels who act as one.
 - A Trinity Mimics can separate into three angels with different abilities or merge into a single unit. 
 - You can bless humans to gain power.
 - You are able to hide your divinity and disguise yourself as a human to lure enemies to you.
 - Your strength is the ability to heal yourself when needed, share HP between all angels when merged, but you can not see what all other chrome angels can see.
