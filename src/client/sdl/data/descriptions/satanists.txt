THE SATANISTS
 - Satanists are allied with demons. They are able to call demons to them for free, curse all enemies in sight with inaccuracy and raise dead.
 - While the undead (which are technically demons possessing dead bodies) are generally weak, there is no shortage of material in the City to create an enormous army.
 - You may play as a Satanist. But beware of the military - you will not be able to conceal the fact that you are an enemy of humankind.
