SHADOW IMP, THE PANDEMONIUM HIERARCHY
 - You start as a puny shadow imp who is no match for an angel. Run or summon help when confronted by one.
 - If you gain enough power, you can climb the Pandemonium Hierarchy up: from a shadow imp to a shadow demon and finally to a shadow devil.
 - You kill humans (or fellow demons, by the way) to gain power and heal.
 - Shadow creatures are unable to possess mortals but can teleport around unlit areas.
 - Beware of blessed ones. When you touch them, you will burn and consume the blessing. Blessed humans are immune to possession. Though the damage from blessings is minor, it may prove fatal in some situations.
 - Your strength is the ability to summon allies to yourself to gang up on your enemy. 
 - Remember, "friendly fire" is allowed for your faction. Be cautious when walking side-by-side with your "friends".
