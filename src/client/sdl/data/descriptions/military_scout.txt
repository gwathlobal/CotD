SCOUT, THE MILITARY 
 - The military arrives towards the end of the battle for the City. It is allied with the citizens but opposes both angels and demons. 
 - The military is comprised of five units: Soldiers, Scouts, Sergeants, Machine-gunners, and Chaplains. All of them are capable of ranged combat but do not gain power whatsoever.
 - Soldiers are armed with single-shot rifles and need to reload every other turn.
 - Sergeants wield six-round revolvers that deal less damage than a rifle but do not need to be reloaded so often.
 - Machine-gunners carry a light machine gun capable of firing the whole magazine in one turn. Alas, its accuracy leaves to be desired. 
 - Chaplains are also armed with six-round revolvers but, more importantly, are able to pray to reveal disguised supernatural enemies or to grant divine protection to allies (similar to priests). They can also issue a "Follow me" order to lead other troops across the battlefield.
 - You start as a scout who has a more powerful rifle than soldiers, are able to reveal the true form of a single enemy, call for an artillery strike and enter the battle riding a horse.
 - Scouts start alone but compensate that with unsurpassed speed. Be careful, though - unlike a Chaplain, you do not have protection from possession. So if a demon traps you in your own body, the you will have to travel with that demon until you are killed with it or freed from it by some angel.
