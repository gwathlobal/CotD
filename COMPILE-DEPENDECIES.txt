City of the Damned depends on the following Common Lisp libraries:
 - LISPBUILDER-SDL
 - BORDEAUX-THREADS

You may download and install them using Quicklisp.

The game is also dependent on DEFENUM, but there is a bug in it at the moment, so DEFENUM sources with the applied fix are located inside "third-party" folder until the fix is merged upstream.
