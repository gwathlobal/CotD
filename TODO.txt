- More realistic auto win chance calculations for campaign mode missions
- Military can not have delayed arrival if no army is present
- Worm-like multitile creatures in hell that devour you while you are inside
- BUG: Fix the bug with military movement on campaign map
- A mission type in the corrupted district not controlled by demons where the military need to capture a number of checkpoints
- BUG: when a creature moves, steps on damage inflicting terrain (on the original tile) and dies, the mob object gets removed from the level due to death, but then finishes the movement as usual. Maybe it is better to create a queue of events where death is checked and inflicted as the last event when necessary (instead of in the middle of an event, like movement)
- Campaign for Lost Soul: library and lair in different sectors, player can move between sectors by going to the edge of the local map
- A style of gameplay where you gain abilities depending on your surroundings
- Angels get conducts (do not kill allies) they should not break or they will get penalized
- Angels get wrath management - when they attack or kill, they accamulate wrath. When wrath reaches a threshold, they get a sin (penalty). To reduce wrath, special abilities should be given. Wrath also enables special powerful abilities which produce even more wrath.
- Malseraph's puppets get additional task from Malseraph
- Alarak-style gameplay where you gain resource when allies get killed and you can sacrifice your allies
- Unstable pocket dimensions - complete the goal before the time expires
- Collapsing pocket dimensions - complete the goal while the map becomes smaller and smaller
- Machine (using devices), Crimson (bio abilities), Ascendant (hybrid bio-machines)
- A mission for satanists where there are no demons or angels, and they need to kill a certain npc and avoid police (or put a certain number of leaflets/runes on the walls)
- Chain Lightning attack
- Beam & Sweep arrack
- Scenario with attacking a battleship
- Resistant flesh ability that triggers on being attacked X% of the times and absorbs N dmg from the attack
- Add Twosoul character for satanists, where players acts as a demon living inside a satanist and acts independetely
- Add Flamethrower operator to the miliatry
- Add courtyard houses like Thief2RL
- Add the Revolutionaries faction
- Add a Thief/Spy campaign
- Move display code to a separate entity (separate thread maybe?) so that you could have some basic movement animation going on (0,5 sec). This will alleviate the performance problem (the game will be still calculating AI while the player movement animation is played) and will generally look good. Make a separate draw loop and a separate game loop
- Optimize connectivity map creation
- Recalculate connectivity after terrain destruction
- Scout's artillery strike ignites appropriate affected tiles
